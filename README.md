# JSGames

this is for bored people who would like to play anonymously little games without any registration or tracking.

# why?

because I like to learn more about JavaScript in my free time and experiment with it. To learn a programming languague you need to program with it - so why not create something other people can enjoy? Of course you could look into the dev tools, but if you are interested, I just put the files right here so you can look through them!

Have Fun
